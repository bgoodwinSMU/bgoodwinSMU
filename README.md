Welcome to my github profile!



My name is Ben G and I work for [Lockheed Martin Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html), doing lots of stuff with data.
I am a statistics person, but I am also attending Southern Methodist University working on a Master's degree in Data Science.  I'm also the owner and founder of [Honest Abe's Bicycle Sellers](https://abesbikes.com/) which is more of a passion project, but a great way to engage in the cycling community and maintain my own bikes in immaculate shape. 
Checkout my [data science portfolio](https://bgoodwinsmu.github.io/index.html).
